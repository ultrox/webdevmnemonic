Mnemonic to help remembering stuff that's not semantic or just ambigious


## A to B

You know about `atob` & `btoa` functions in javascript, they don't make sense even though `A` should stand for ASCII and `b` to binary, and then you could razionalize that `b` might  be base64, but actually it's reverse.

* `atob` -> Decodes base64 
* `btoa` -> Encodes the string

Mnemonic to use: Beutiful to Awful
> You take your beutiful string and turn it to something aweful `btoa("beutiful string")`

## Shift the array

`.shift` & `.unshift`

Mnemonic to use:
* .unshift - makes it bigger. Longer word than .shift
* .shift - makes it smaller. Shorter word than .unshift
